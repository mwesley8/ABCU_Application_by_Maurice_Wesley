# ABCU_Application
The computer science department wanted an application that would help them advise students in critical curriculum areas.  I had an opportunity to work with several different data structures during this term. I identified the best structure for the ABCU application specification requirements. My approach was similar to the waterfall concept: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. I would be remise if I were to say that I did not run into any roadblocks. I was not previously instructed how to read and parse an improperly formatted comma separated values file. I overcame many roadblocks with extensive research, due diligence, effort, and hard work.
The understanding of data structures is analogous to the understanding of a tool belt. One tool is better than another tool for a specific job. Understanding data structures helps the developer operate within predefined tolerances. Previously, I did not work with structs. I created classes and used custom overloaded constructors to create custom objects. This class helped me implement different methodologies to accomplish the same task. The work that I did on this project helped evolve the way I write programs by giving me an opportunity to practice and encapsulate all the principles of programming that I have learned in previous classes.
